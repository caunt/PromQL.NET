**PromQL has two basic types of data on which you can select and aggregate time series data in real time.**

**So were going to talk about instant vector and range vector.**

### Example #1:
Create InstantVector and apply "sum" aggregation operator on it: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators
```csharp
var query = InstantVector
    .WithString("http_requests_total")
    .Sum();

Console.WriteLine(query);
// OUTPUT: sum(http_requests_total)
```
### Example #2:
For now were using RangeVector instead of InstantVector, selecting http requests count per instance, and sorting it in descending order:
```csharp
var query = RangeVector
    .WithString("http_requests_total", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15))
    .SumOverTime()  // Same "sum" aggregation operator as in InstantVector, but applies to RangeVector and returns as result InstantVector (!) instead of RangeVector
    .SumWithFilter(
        LabelFilter.Create()
            .WithType(LabelFilterType.By)
            .AddField("instance"))
    .SortDescending();

Console.WriteLine(query);
// OUTPUT: sort_desc(sum by (instance) (sum_over_time(http_requests_total[15s])))
```

Our goal is to make everything to work as expected and prevent wrong syntax in generated prometheus queries.
